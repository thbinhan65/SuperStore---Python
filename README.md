## Project Title: SuperStore - RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

## Introduction:

Welcome to the SuperStore analysis project! This repository focuses on analyzing customer value to help SuperStore identify distinct customer segments. The goal is to inform targeted marketing campaigns during the holiday season, enhancing customer appreciation and loyalty.

## Objective:
Utilize the RFM model to analyze customer data, segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior. This analysis will aid in crafting tailored marketing strategies to engage existing customers and attract potential loyal customers. The project will leverage large datasets to automate segmentation, moving beyond manual methods.

## Analysis Focus:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Prepare the dataset suitable for the RFM model.
  
2. **RFM Score Calculation:**
   - Define and calculate Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M) scores for each customer, using December 31, 2011, as the reference date.

3. **Scoring Methodology:**
   - Implement a scoring system from 1 to 5 using quintile methods for statistical analysis.

4. **Customer Grouping:**
   - Use the classification table to group customers into segments based on their RFM scores.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the distribution of segments across various dimensions.

6. **Current Status Analysis:**
   - Analyze the current state of the company and provide insights for the marketing team.

7. **Strategic Recommendations:**
   - Suggest key metrics for the marketing and sales teams to focus on, tailored to SuperStore's retail model.
